  - Clone this repo and build the app locally: https://github.com/pmendelski/java-react-example.git

    - Run the app on the server

    application is ruuning on port 7071

    opening the same port in inbound rules of the security group attached to this instance

    accessing the app in new tab with public IPv4:7071 or PublicDNS:7071

    we can see the logs on server

    Running the app in detached mode

    Checking the port on which the app is running in detached mode

    Security best practice is to not run the app/services as a root user, instead create a separate user for each service/app with minimum needed permissions to run the app
    switch user to demo and public key for the same as we have configured the public key just for the root user.

    adding the public key to this user in .ssh folder --> authorized_keys file
